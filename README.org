* General Policies
** Grading
*** Final Exam
    The final exam will be "take-home", and be made available by 11am on
    Monday, May 10.  It will be due 24 hours later.
*** Discussions
    Given that group work is harder now, we'd like to try an
    alternative to group problem sets, while still encouraging
    collaboration.

    So: for the 2nd half of the class, rather than completing several
    formal problem sets, we ask you to participate in discussions on
    piazza.com.

    My intention is to post different discussion prompts every week.
    There are two things (well, five) I then ask of you each week: 

       - Respond to /two/ or more of my discussion prompts.  
         Please post these responses earlier rather than later.

       - Comment on at least /three/ of the posts responding to the
         discussion prompt (i.e., comment on others comments).  A
         livelier discussion will result if you don't wait until the
         last minute to post these comments, so that there's some
         opportunity for dialog.  
 
    The goal here is to have constructive discussions, to help us all
    in our thinking about interesting topics in econometrics.  Our
    "grading" of your remarks will be restricting to counting them and
    to noting when we think your remarks are good (we'll "like" them).
    The bar for a good remark isn't really very high--we just want to
    see that you're contributing constructively to the conversation.
    We're basically looking for active, constructive participation.
    It's perfectly fine for you to have little filler remarks, like
    "great question!", but we'd hope to see other remarks with more
    substantive thought or content.

** Readings
  - "Hansen" refers to Gary Hansen's [[https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf][Econometrics Textbook]].
  - Unresolved references of the form "cite:foo84" or similar are keys
    with values that can be looked up in
    [[file:are212.bib][are212.bib]].  This last is a bibtex database which
    you're free to use.  The bibtex file includes some links to pdf
    files which you may find useful.
