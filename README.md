# General Policies

## Grading


<a id="orgc7ff327"></a>

### Final Exam

The final exam will be &ldquo;take-home&rdquo;, and be made available by 11am on
Tuesday, May 9 (if there is a **consensus** that an earlier date is
preferable then we can reschedule).  You will have 24 hours to
complete the final.


<a id="org7e800be"></a>

### Groups

You should regard yourself as a member of a **group**, and your
group will be responsible for working together on certain
assignments.  Group sizes should be between 3&#x2013;6 (inclusive).


<a id="org8df682d"></a>

### Assignments

We will ask you to complete an assignment every 2&#x2013;3 weeks.  We expect you to work on these with others in your group.  Your **group** should turn in *one* set of notes and proposed solutions.  The problem sets will feature two different kinds of problems.

1.  Exercises

    These are called *exercises* because they are meant more as tests of comprehension
    than as more difficult *problems*.  Exercises will be graded on a &ldquo;check&rdquo;, &ldquo;check +&rdquo;, &ldquo;check -&rdquo; system.
    
    Not completing an exercise will be much worse for the grades of people in your group than receiving a &ldquo;check -&rdquo;.

2.  Problems

    *Problems* are meant less as checks on comprehension and more the part of the assignment that involves more critical thinking.  &ldquo;Problems&rdquo; may not have a &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer (though there will always be many wrong answers).

## Readings

-   &ldquo;Hansen&rdquo; refers to Bruce Hansen&rsquo;s [Econometrics Textbook](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf).  This was recently published by Princeton University Press, and belongs on your bookshelf.
-   Other readings will be added topic by topic (usually these will be available electronically).

# Other Resources

## Friday Sections

Lucy Hackett will hold weekly sections on Fridays.  She&rsquo;ll present
material pertaining to both econometrics and programming.

It&rsquo;s critical to note that we expect you to develop some fluency in
the programming language `python`.

## HowTos

-   **GitHub:** How to view, files, fork, edit, and issue pull requests
    (PRs).  <https://youtu.be/krDQk5ZzP8U>
-   **GitHub to DataHub:** How to use datahub to run & edit code from
    github:  <https://youtu.be/HBM8jgvYPtA>
